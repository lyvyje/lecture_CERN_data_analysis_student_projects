For my project I would like to collect data using API.

At first I wanted to use the data about Mars Weather, but due to very limited amounts of data this idea was scrapped.

Now I wish to analyze data about NEOs - Near Earth Objects. It gives information about space objects (mostly asteroids) which come to close proximity to Earth. Most of them are harmless, but others may actually pose some POSSIBLE threat to Earth. I wish to look into it more.
